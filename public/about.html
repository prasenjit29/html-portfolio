<h1>Hello It's Me Prasenjit</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m a passionate full-stack developer based in Ramachandrapuram, Telangana, India. 
  With a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I thrive on building robust web applications from start to finish. 
  On the front-end, I craft engaging user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
  Whether itâ€™s responsive designs, animations, or seamless interactions, I love making the user experience delightful.</p>

<p>When it comes to the back-end, I dive into server-side logic, databases, and APIs. 
  Python, SQL, and Node.js are my trusty companions. 
  I enjoy architecting scalable systems, optimizing queries, and ensuring data integrity. 
  Whether itâ€™s RESTful APIs, authentication, or handling complex business logic, Iâ€™m up for the challenge.</p>

<p>In my spare time, youâ€™ll find me exploring new frameworks, contributing to open-source projects, 
  and staying curious about emerging technologies. Letâ€™s connect and discuss code, databases, and all things full-stack! ðŸš€</p>
